            <b>Primary School </b><br><br>I was
            completed my primay education in <b>shree maruti vidyamandir, janvali</b>. I clearly remember my first day
            at school and the memories of this day are still vivid. I can still feel how warmly I was welcomed at the
            school. Such a warm welcome can truly define a child‚Äôs school experience in the best possible way. I made my
            lot of fun. and also
            made
            my memorable moment in that school. There was made my childhood in that school. That school is very special
            for me. Because its my first school and I teach from 1st standard to 7th standard. The school life is the
            best life. Anyone who has been a student, knows what school life is all about: It is the golden period of
            learning and it truly impacts students‚Äô lives.<br>
            <b>Until now, When I remember the things that happen in class, I still smile because I enjoyed it.<br> Goods
                times come and go but the school memories will last forever.</b>

            made
            my memorable moment in that school. I was teach about how to improve our confidence on the stage. Learning
            and experience at secondary school is totally different from that of Primary school. Each day is
            remarkable and memorable. Some students like me, who have experienced unforgettable moments during their
            secondary school time, always crave to share their memories. Though in those days we didn‚Äôt care much about
            our studies, yet as we grew up, we realised what our parents often used to say; ‚ÄòOne day you‚Äôll realise how
            much you‚Äôll miss your school days. Believe me, my secondary school time was the ‚ÄòGolden Era‚Äô of my life. A
            path filled with excitement, fortitude and downfalls. Getting transformed into an individual that no one
            could ever envision is something incredible!
